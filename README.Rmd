# PRE-RELEASE
## DistRegLMERR - Logisitic Mean Embeddings Ridge Regression (LMERR) for the Distribution Regression problem.


### SAA 2018 Abstract
A model of Distribution Regression using Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR) on Mean Feature Space Embeddings is developed to address two primary shortcomings of current Archaeological Predictive Modeling (APM) practice; 1) neglecting the richness of archaeological landforms by collapsing a site to a single point or observation; and 2) disregarding the implicit and explicit uncertainty of archaeological data, predictions, and model parameters. This research addresses the first hurdle by developing a KLR on embeddings approach to Distribution Regression. This method first samples a distribution of variable measurements from the spatial area of each site, then uses a kernel to project the distributions into a non-geographical feature space to calculate mean embeddings, finally Kernel Logistic Regression estimates similarity coefficients for inference and prediction. The primary benefits of this approach to APM are the consideration of archaeological landform richness and variation, explicitly modeling similarity between sites and the environment, and allowing for similarity metrics specific to archaeological research questions. The second hurdle is addressed by applying the MERR method within a Bayesian framework for probabilistic modeling. As such, the uncertainty of data and parameters can be explicitly modeled with priors resulting in a posterior predictive distribution useful for quantifying and visualizing risk.

* Note: Changes from original abstract; 1) change of terms to Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR); and 2) deemphasized Bayesian approach as it is a work in progress. The repo contains working Stan code for probabilistic models, but they are not ready for prime-time.
